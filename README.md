My first project after learning javascript

I created this project after learning the basics of javascript, to test my form validation skills and Local Storage, set and get skills, Including creating necessary contents (write-ups) for websites and creating a responsive dashboard and few other numerous logical statements used in the project, I know my responsive skill is not A1 but i am just a beginner with less than 3 months(as at  the time of creating this respository) of experience and i created this project from scratch, I am open to Critics creatively.
